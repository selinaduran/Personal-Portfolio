# Personal-Portfolio

Hey there! This is a project for my personal portfolio website that is compiled from using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First open your terminal and cd into the "personal_portfolio" folder.

Once there, if you want to run the application from your local computer - run the development server using either of the following commands within your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see my awesome portfolio website! 😀

## Don't want to run the application from your local computer? Not a problem!
